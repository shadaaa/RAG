# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with FAISS Vector Store
This repository contains code for implementing retrieval augmented generation using FAISS vector store. RAG is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models for natural language processing tasks, such as text generation and question answering.

# Overview
Retrieval augmented generation leverages a pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT, GPT) along with a large collection of text embeddings stored in a FAISS vector store. During inference, the model retrieves relevant passages from the FAISS vector store based on similarity scores, and then generates responses conditioned on the retrieved context.

# Features
Integration of FAISS vector store for efficient retrieval of relevant passages.
Implementation of RAG model architecture using popular deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).
Support for fine-tuning on specific tasks and datasets.
Evaluation scripts for assessing the performance of the RAG model.

# Requirements
Python 3.14
langchain
FAISS
